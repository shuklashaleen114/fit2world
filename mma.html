                    Mixed martial arts (MMA) sometimes referred to as cage fighting, is a full-contact combat sport
                    based on striking,
                    grappling and ground fighting, incorporating techniques from various combat sports and martial arts
                    from around the world.
                    The first documented use of the term mixed martial arts was in a review of UFC 1 by television
                    critic Howard Rosenberg in 1993.
                    The question of who actually coined the term is subject to debate.

                    During the early 20th century, various interstylistic contests took place throughout Japan and in
                    the countries of the Four
                    Asian Tigers. In Brazil, there was the sport of Vale Tudo, in which fighters from various styles
                    fought with little to no rules.
                    The Gracie family was known to promote Vale Tudo matches as a way to promote their own Brazilian
                    jiu-jitsu style. In the West,
                    the concept of combining elements of multiple martial arts was popularized by Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune
                    Do during the late 1960s to
                    early 1970s. A precursor to modern MMA was the 1976 Muhammad Ali vs. Antonio Inoki bout, fought
                    between boxer Muhammad Ali and
                    wrestler Antonio Inoki in Japan, where it later inspired the foundation of Pancrase in 1993 and
                    Pride Fighting Championships in
                    1997.

                    Originally promoted as a competition to find the most effective martial arts for real unarmed
                    combat, competitors from different
                    fighting styles were pitted against one another in contests with relatively few rules. Later,
                    individual fighters incorporated

                    multiple martial arts into their style. MMA promoters were pressured to adopt additional rules to
                    increase competitors' safety,
                    to comply with sport regulations and to broaden mainstream acceptance of the sport. Following these
                    changes, the sport has seen
                    increased popularity with a pay-per-view business that rivals boxing and professional wrestling.

                    In Ancient China, combat sport appeared in the form of Leitai, a no-holds-barred mixed combat sport
                    that combined
                    Chinese martial arts, boxing and wrestling.

                    In Ancient Greece, there was a sport called pankration, which featured grappling and striking skills
                    similar to those found in
                    modern MMA. Pankration was formed by combining the already established wrestling and boxing
                    traditions and, in Olympic terms,
                    first featured in the 33rd Olympiad in 648 BC. All strikes and holds were allowed with the exception
                    of biting and gouging,
                    which were banned. The fighters, called pankratiasts, fought until someone could not continue or
                    signaled submission by raising
                    their index finger; there were no rounds. According to the historian E. Norman Gardiner, "No branch
                    of athletics was more popular
                    than the pankration." There is also evidence of similar mixed combat sports in Ancient Egypt, India
                    and Japan.

                    critic Howard Rosenberg,
                    in 1993. The term gained popularity when the website newfullcontact.com, then one of the biggest
                    covering the sport, hosted
                    and reprinted the article. The first use of the term by a promotion was in September 1995 by Rick
                    Blume, president and CEO of
                    Battlecade Extreme Fighting, just after UFC 7. UFC official Jeff Blatnick was responsible for the
                    Ultimate Fighting Championship
                    officially adopting the name mixed martial arts. It was previously marketed as "Ultimate Fighting"
                    and "No Holds Barred (NHB)",
                    until Blatnick and John McCarthy proposed the name "MMA" at the UFC 17 rules meeting in response to
                    increased public criticism.
                    The question as to who actually coined the name is still in debate.

                    The first state regulated MMA event was held in Biloxi, Mississippi on August 23, 1996 with the
                    sanctioning of IFC's Mayhem
                    in Mississippi show by the Mississippi Athletic Commission under William Lyons. The rules used were
                    an adaptation of the
                    kickboxing rules already accepted by most state athletic commissions. These modified kickboxing
                    rules allowed for take
                    downs and ground fighting and did away with rounds, although they did allow for fighters to be stood
                    up by the referee
                    and restarted if there was no action on the ground. These rules were the first in modern MMA to
                    define fouls, fighting
                    surfaces and the use of the cage.
                </p>

                <p align="justify">
                    In March 1997, the Iowa Athletic Commission officially sanctioned Battlecade Extreme Fighting under
                    a modified form of its
                    existing rules for Shootfighting. These rules created the three 5 minute round, one-minute break
                    format, and mandated
                    shootfighting gloves, as well as weight classes, for the first time. Illegal blows were listed as
                    groin strikes, head
                    butting, biting, eye gouging, hair pulling, striking an opponent with an elbow while the opponent is
                    on the mat, kidney
                    strikes, and striking the back of the head with closed fist. Holding onto the ring or cage for any
                    reason was defined as a
                    foul. While there are minor differences between these and the final Unified Rules, notably regarding
                    elbow strikes, the Iowa
                    rules allowed mixed martial arts promoters to conduct essentially modern events legally, anywhere in
                    the state. On March 28,
                    1997, Extreme Fighting 4 was held under these rules, making it the first show conducted under a
                    version of the modern rules.
